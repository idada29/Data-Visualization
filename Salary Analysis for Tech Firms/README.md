This report examines salary differences and norms across various work locations, demographics, years of experience, and job titles. The purpose of this report is to assess the differences in current average pay in these 4 companies and to suggest probable variables that might impact improved compensation negotiations.

## Findings and Conclusions – 
The following are the findings of the business intelligence report's analysis of the above-mentioned business questions:
•	Most paid Entry level jobs locations are Google in Fremont USA with average earnings of $190000 USD, Amazon in Berkeley USA  with average earnings of $180000 USD, Facebook in Burlingame USA with average earnings of $170500 USD, Microsoft in Zurich Switzerland with average earnings of $151500 USD.
•	Across the four companies, 59.40% of total employees earn more than the average income for their position.
•	With an average salary of $139238.17 USD, software engineers are the most paid of the five races. Also, across the four organisations, employees who identify with two or more races receive higher average earnings.
•	For job roles such as software engineer and data scientist, the minimum number of years for average years of experience is 3.57 years and 3.63 years, respectively.
•	Within each of the four firms, there is a high percentage of employees who have been with the company for 25 to 30 years. As a result, this range has the highest average salary of all the career status categories.
•	For employees with a PhD, the average salary is more likely to increase by approximately $22000 USD. 
•	The greatest contributor to increased average salary is Senior career position, which raises the average income by more than $72000 USD, followed by a range of years inside the company of at least 10-15 years, which raises the average salary by $39.27k. The average income for a Software engineer manager is $33.55k USD higher than the average salary for others. Furthermore, if the company is Facebook, the average income is likely to increase by $26,000 USD. 

## Recommendations
•	The average incomes in Burma and Giza should be improved over time, given they are among the lowest-paid countries.
•	For senior roles, the salary gap between men and women is quite large, and this should be highlighted by individuals during negotiations.
•	A greater emphasis should be made on senior-level pay, which are significantly lower than the industry average.
•	Employees who can obtain a PhD to do so since it raises the average income and allows for better compensation discussions.
•	Companies should increase the rate at which average salaries grow, as it has been discovered that the most significant increase in average salary occurs after ten years of service.
