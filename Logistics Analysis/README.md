Excited to share the results of my latest project - a logistics dashboard for a retail firm handling an average of $11M in orders a year from its customers.

The findings gave me a clear picture of the payment preferences of customers, which will be a game-changer for the business's future strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Debit card dominates the spending landscape with a whopping 12.6 million dollars!

ðŸ“Œ Transfer follows closely with $9.2 million, proving to be a popular payment option.

ðŸ“Œ High number of pending and cancelled orders should be addressed to improve overall processing efficiency.

ðŸ“Œ To reduce pending orders, the firm should focus on streamlining card payment process and enhancing fraud detection measures.

ðŸ“Œ To reduce cancelled transactions, the firm should consider conducting customer satisfaction surveys and improving the ordering and delivery experience for customers.
